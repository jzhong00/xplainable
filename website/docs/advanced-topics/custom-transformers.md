# Custom Transformers
Custom transformers are user-defined functions that transform data in an XPipeline. They are defined in a separate file and imported into a Python session.

Custom transformers inherit from the `XBaseTransformer` class in the xplainable package. The `XBaseTransformer` class provides several methods you can override to customize the transformerâ€™s behaviour. The most important of these is the transform method, which every transformer in a pipeline will call.

You can find details about the XBaseTransformer class in the API documentation.

## Example
To create a custom transformer, create a Python file in your working directory called custom_transformers.py. In this file, define a class that inherits from `XBaseTransformer`:

```python
from xplainable.core.preprocessing.base import XBaseTransformer

class MyTransformer(XBaseTransformer):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    # Optional
    def fit(self, data):
        # learn something from the data
        return data

    # Required
    def transform(self, data):
        # do something to the data
        return data

    # Optional
    def inverse_transform(self, data):
        # reverse the transformation
        return data
```

You can then import this class into a Python session and use it in an XPipeline:

```python
from xplainable.preprocessing.pipeline import XPipeline
from custom_transformers import MyTransformer

pipeline = XPipeline([
    {"transformer": MyTransformer()},
])
```
