# Partitioned Models

## What are Partitioned Models?

Partitioned models are a way of training xplainable models split into multiple 
parts. Each part is a trained model on a subset of the data. The partitioned model 
combines these models and often yields more accurate results than training a single 
model on all the data. Partitioning the models can also provide a more in-depth 
explanation of the model and overall data.

Individual partitions can be stand-alone models, or the partitioned-model object 
can facilitate predictions across all partitions when the X data contains mixed 
data across partitions.

It is important to note that partitioned models are not the same as an ensemble 
of models. Partitioned models are trained on different data subsets and combined 
to form a single model. It is also important to note that partitioned models, 
like stand-alone models, are more likely to perform well when there is sufficient 
data.

### Example 

You can train a partitioned model by creating a model object based from the 
BasePartition class and adding models to it. Each model has an associated key 
(name) used to reference the model. These keys derive from the unique values in 
a column identified as the partition_on column. So, when you pass X values to 
the predict method of a partitioned model, the correct embedded model is used 
for each respective row:


```python
from xplainable.core.models import PartitionedClassifier
from xpainable.core.models import XClassifier
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Train your model (this will open an embedded gui)
partitioned_model = PartitionedClassifier(partition_on='partition_column')

# Iterate over the unique values in the partition column
for partition in train['partition_column'].unique():
      # Get the data for the partition
      part = train[train['partition_column'] == partition]
      x_train, y_train = part.drop('target', axis=1), part['target']

      # Fit the embedded model
      model = XClassifier()
      model.fit(x_train, y_train)

      # Add the model to the partitioned model
      partitioned_model.add_partition(model, partition)

# Prepare the test data
x_test, y_test = test.drop('target', axis=1), test['target']

# Predict on the partitioned model
y_pred = partitioned_model.predict(x_test)

```

You can access the individual models in the partitioned model by calling the 
`.partitions` attribute. This attribute will return a dictionary of the models, 
where the keys are the unique values in the partition_on column.

Every partitioned model will contain a default partition called `__dataset__`. 
This partition is the default model used when the partition_on column is not 
present in the X data or if you pass an unknown partition to the predict method. 
It is trained across the entire dataset and acts as a fallback.:

```python
# Access the default model
model = partitioned_model.partitions['__dataset__']
```
