# Installation

## Quickstart

PyPI is the distribution channel for xplainable release versions. The best way to install it is with pip:

```Python
pip install xplainable
```


## Optional dependencies

To use xplainable’s embedded GUI in jupyter, you will need to install `xplainable` with the `gui` extra:

```Python
pip install xplainable[gui]
```

To use xplainable’s advanced plotting functions, you will need to install `xplainable` with the `plotting` extra:

```Python
pip install xplainable[plotting]
```

## Environment

### Working in Jupyter

The `xplainable` GUI relies heavily on `ipywidgets`. Unfortunately, this requires a strict environment to ensure that it renders as expected. Ensuring that you have correctly installed the required dependencies before using the xplainable GUI is essential.

For now, we recommend using Python 3.8 when working with the GUI. This environment will yield the best visible results until we can stabilise `ipywidgets` for later versions of Python.

### Known Tornado Issue with the xplainable GUI

Versions of `tornado` greater than 6.1 are known to cause issues with the jupyter kernel and `ipywidgets`. We recommend using `tornado==6.1` for now.

### Reproducible Installs

As libraries get updated, results from running your code can change, or your code can break completely. It’s essential to be able to reconstruct the set of packages and versions you’re using. Best practice is to:

1. use a different environment per project you’re working on,
2. record package names and versions using your package installer; each has its own metadata format for this:

   * Conda: conda environments and environment.yml
   * Pip: virtual environments and requirements.txt
   * Poetry: virtual environments and pyproject.toml
